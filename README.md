# What is a tower defense ?
Tower defense (TD) is a subgenre of strategy games where the goal is to defend a player's territories or possessions by obstructing 
the enemy attackers or by stopping enemies from reaching the exits, usually achieved by placing defensive structures on or along their path of attack.
